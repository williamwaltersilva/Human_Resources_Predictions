# Human_Resources_Predictions


## Abstract
In this final part, we will predict who are the employees that can leave the company in the future. To do this, we will work with supervised algorithms such as Random Forest and K Nearest Neighbors Classifiers. The results are compared and evaluation metrics are calculated: Precision, Recall, F1 Score and Area Under the ROC Curve. Finally we will apply an unsupervised learning algorithm as K-means to the original data to obtain insights about abnormal behavior in the employees clusters. With this information it is possible for managers to improve the strategy to retain the best employees.
